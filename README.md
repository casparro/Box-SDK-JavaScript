Box JavaScript API
==================

The JavaScript API is meant to be dropped into an existing website. 

Security
--------

Due to the security restrictions applied (for good reason) to the JavaScript
runtime within web browsers, this API is not allowed the same ease of use as
some other APIs.

Most notably,
*   each user will need to submit their credentials each time (unless you use cookies)
*   special effort needs to be made to proxy requests or embed the js in an iframe. (TODO -- blog post)

The Box API
===========
All users of the Box API are required to register for an API key. Instructions
for this as well most other questions you may have may be found at
http://developers.box.net/
